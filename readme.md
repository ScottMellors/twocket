# Twocket - (Twitch Socket)

## About Twitch Eventsub Websockets

Current in beta, the websocket interface for the Eventsub events is now available. 

Learn more [here](https://dev.twitch.tv/docs/eventsub/handling-websocket-events).

## Installation

```npm i twocket``` SoonTm

or Copy the Twocket.ts into your project. (Like a goblin)

## Get Started
 - Create an instance of a Twocket using the contructor
 - Add listeners for which events you want to listen for (each event has their own returned data type for convenience that match the api [here](https://dev.twitch.tv/docs/eventsub/eventsub-subscription-types).)
 - start it up with start()

## TODO 

 - make logging an option as part of the twocket.
 - extract the interfaces to their own file.
